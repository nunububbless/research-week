Logistic Regression vs Linear Regression: Logistic regression is used for binary classification where the output can be either yes/no , 0/1 , true/false
There are three main types of logistic regression: Bionomial Logistic Regression (0/1 type, most common...), Multinomial Logistic Regression: three+ unordered categories and Orinal Logistic Regression: three+ ordered categories.
There are some assumptions made: In logistic regression, each data point is independent of the others. The dep variable is binary- only 2 values. independent variables and the log odds have a linear relationships. there are no extreme outliers and there is a large sample size of data.
Sigmoid Function is an S shape curve ranging from 0 to 1.
